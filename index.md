*where science meets imagination, and where sketches, ideas, and experiments all find a home*

This site brings together different sides of me — my research as a **biologist**, my passion for **communicating science**, and my **art**, both scientific and personal. 

Here you’ll find a mix of projects and creations, from data and models to sketches and illustrations — a portfolio that reflects both my work and my curiosity.
