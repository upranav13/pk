Hi, I’m Pranav. Almost all of my scientific work revolves around a simple but profound question: how do organisms adapt and evolve? Over the years, I’ve studied this from different angles, and in the process, I’ve also had to adapt myself—learning to work across disciplines and develop a broad toolkit. My skill set has made me something of a “jack of all trades,” and I’m continually working to deepen it while staying open to new perspectives.

Outside of research, I enjoy exploring the creative side of things. I’m not a professional artist or designer, but I’ve found drawing, illustration, and design to be powerful ways of thinking, experimenting, and sharing ideas. Some of this overlaps with my science—visualizations and graphics that make data and concepts more approachable—while other pieces are simply personal art that I make for the joy of creating.

This site brings those sides together. It’s a space where I collect the different things I work on and care about: research, communication, and art. For me, they’re all connected by curiosity, creativity, and a desire to keep learning.
